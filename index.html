		<h2 id='top'>What is Pithos?</h2>
		<p>Pithos is an online Python IDE, written entirely within JavaScript. It is highly extendible, and supports the following:
			<ul>
				<li>Over 50+ libraries
				<li>Local file cache
				<li>Filecodes and data saving
				<li>And more!
			</ul>
			Pithos also has it's very own PyCode extension, which allows you to parse Python Code embedded in a webpage, a useful Python Shell
			that you can access in your web browser, File I/O support <i>on your own computer</i>, a JavaScript console, and all kinds of other
			cool additions to your web browser. More information about PyCode can be found <a href='#pycode'>here</a>.</p>

		<h2>What is PyCode, exactly?</h2>
		<p>PyCode is a combination of Developer Tools for JavaScript and Developer Tools for Python. It allows you to run and embed Python
		code into a webpage, like this:
			<pre>
				&lt;%python%
					&lt;p&gt;This was printed with Python!&lt;p&gt;
				%&gt;
			</pre>
		Running that code would display:
			<div class='code-snippet-output'>
				<p>This was printed with Python!</p>
			</div>
		It also contains a Python Shell, JavaScript shell, File I/O manager(for when the code tries to use it), and all kinds
		of other features. PyCode also works seamlessly with Pithos, allowing it to read files outside of the virtual file
		file system.</p>
